Exercise 2.7: Catalan numbers
The Catalan numbers Cn are a sequence of integers 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132. . . that play an important role in quantum mechanics and the theory of disordered systems. (They were central to Eugene Wignerâ€™s proof of the so-called semicircle law.) They are given by
C0 = 1, Cn+1 = (4n + 2)/(n+2)  * Cn. 
Write a program that prints in increasing order all Catalan numbers less than or equal to one billion.
