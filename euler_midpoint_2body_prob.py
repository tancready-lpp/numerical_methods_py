"""
Write a new script to implement Eulerâ€™s method to evolve a system of two points in two dimensions (xy plane), 
subject to gravity forces, with the following initial conditions.
Initial positions of particles 1 and 2 (in the plane xy): x = (1.0, -1.0), y = (1.0, -1.0). 
x1 = (1.0,1.0) v1 = (-0.5, 0.0)
x1 = (-1.0,-1.0) v2 = (0.5, 0.0)
Initial velocities of particles 1 and 2 (in the plane xy): vx = (-0.5, 0.5), vy = (0.0, 0.0).

Let us assume that the masses are m1 = m2 = 1, and the gravity constant in our units is G = 1.
Let us assume t0 = 0, tfin = 300 and h = 0.01. The result should look like the blue line in Figure 42.
