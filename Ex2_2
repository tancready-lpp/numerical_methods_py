"""
A satellite is to be launched into a circular orbit around the Earth
so that it orbits the planet once every T seconds.

Show that the altitude h above the Earth’s surface that the satellite must have is 

h =(GMT^2/4π^2)^1/3 -R

where G = 6.67 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 is Newton’s gravitational constant,
M = 5.97 ×10^24 kg is the mass of the Earth, and R = 6371 km is its radius. """
